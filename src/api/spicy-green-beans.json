      "items": [
        "1 tsp vegetable oil",
        "½ lb green beans, ends trimmed, chopped into bite-size pieces",
        "2 cloves garlic, finely chopped",
        "1 tsp soy sauce",
        "1 tsp sambal oelek (or 2 tsp chili flakes)"

  "steps": [
      "Add the vegetable oil to a frying pan on medium heat. Once it’s hot, add the green beans. Let them cook undisturbed for about 1 minute.",
      "Mix the garlic, soy sauce, and sambal oelek in a bowl (and the ginger and lemon juice, if using).",
      "The beans should have turned bright green. Add about ¼ cup of water to the pan. Cook another 2 minutes, until the water is mostly gone. Pour the sauce into the pan and toss gently to coat. Cook another 2 minutes, until everything is fragrant and most of the liquid is gone. Poke the beans with a fork: if it goes through easily, they’re done. They should take about 5 minutes.",
      "Taste and add more chili sauce or soy sauce if you want the beans hotter or saltier."
