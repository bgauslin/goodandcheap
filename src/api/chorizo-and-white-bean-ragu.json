  "overview": "<p>When my friend Chris told me he loves a good ragu, I worked to develop a version that is as hearty as a meaty tomato sauce without the expense and heaviness of a traditional ragu. A batch of this is probably enough for four people, served with grated Romano or Parmesan over pasta, polenta, or grits.</p>",
  "ingredients": [
    {
      "items": [
        "1 tbsp butter or vegetable oil",
        "1 onion, chopped",
        "3 cloves garlic, finely chopped",
        "1 tbsp jalapeño, finely chopped (optional)",
        "½ lb fresh chorizo, casing removed",
        "1½ cups canned or fresh tomatoes, puréed",
        "1½ cups butter beans, navy beans, or cannelini beans",
        "salt and pepper"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "steps": [
      "Melt the butter in a pan over medium heat and swirl it to coat the pan. Add the chopped onion and cook until it turns translucent. Toss in the garlic, jalapeño, and fresh chorizo (or any other kind of fresh sausage), then sauté for about a minute. Add the tomatoes and beans, then simmer until the sauce is thick and the sausage is cooked, about 5 minutes on medium heat. Taste and add salt and pepper as needed.",
      "Because this sauce contains meat, it won’t keep especially long in the fridge, but you can freeze it for later use if you don’t plan to eat it all within a few days."
