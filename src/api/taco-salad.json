  "overview": "<p>This salad is a great use for leftover beans (or pulled pork)—crunchy, fresh, yet satisfying enough to be a whole meal. I like to make taco salad in a week where I’ve made a large batch of beans and I’m craving something fresh.</p>",

      "items": [
        "4 cups lettuce, chopped",
        "1 cup beans, pulled pork, or ground beef",

        "½ cup corn, canned or fresh",
        "2-3 scallions, finely chopped",
        "1 cup tortilla chips, roughly crushed",

      "Mix up the dressing and taste it. Adjust the salt, pepper, and lime to your liking.",
