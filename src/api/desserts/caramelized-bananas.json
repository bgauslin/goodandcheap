  "overview": "<p>These bananas—cooked in just a bit of caramel—are crispy and gooey on the outside and almost like a soft pudding inside. Sweet, messy, and irresistible.</p>",
  "ingredients": [
    {
      "items": [
        "2 bananas, peeled and split in half",
        "1 tbsp butter",
        "2 tbsp brown sugar"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "steps": [
      "Melt the butter in a non-stick or cast-iron pan on medium-high heat. Add the sugar and let it melt into the butter for about 2 minutes. Place the bananas face down in the butter-sugar mixture, then cook for 2 minutes or until they become brown and sticky. Carefully flip them over and do the same to the other side.",
      "Serve them whole or split them into quarters. Drizzle any caramel left in the pan over the bananas. Serve with ice cream or on their own."
