    {
      "items": [
        "2 grapefruit",
        "2 tbsp brown sugar",

    }
  ],
  "steps": [
      "Turn on the broiler in your oven.",
      "Split a grapefruit in half and place it on a baking tray or in an oven-proof pan. Sprinkle the pink halves evenly with sugar and top with just a tiny bit of salt to bring out the flavor.",
      "Place the grapefruit halves under the broiler until they turn bubbly and a little brown (or even black) around the edges. This usually takes about 3 minutes, but monitor it because every broiler is different. Donâ€™t get distracted! Overbroiling ruins a good meal fast.",
      "If you have maple syrup on hand, use it instead of sugar for even more flavor."
