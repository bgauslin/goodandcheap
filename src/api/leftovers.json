  "overview": "<p>Leftovers are convenient, but can seem unappealing, limp, and cold after sitting in the fridge for a couple of days. That’s why the sandwich, the wrap, and the taco are your friend. Here are just a few ideas for how to give leftovers a makeover very quickly for a whole new meal!</p><h2>Tomato Scrambled Eggs Wrap</h2><p>Throw the tomato eggs into a wrap and add some roasted potatoes or rice for bulk.</p><h2>Jacket Sweet Potatoes Spread</h2><p>Mash up leftover baked sweet potatoes, then spread them in a bacon sandwich for a sweet counterpoint.</p><h2>Toast Toppings on Anything</h2><p>Any of the toast toppings would work in a wrap, as a calzone filling, or as a pizza topping.</p><h2>Cauliflower Tacos</h2><p>Tacos are the perfect re-use of roasted cauliflower.</p><h2>Chana Masala Wrap</h2><p>Sounds strange, but spread some herbed mayo on the wrap and then pile in the chana masala.</p><h2>Black-eyed Peas and Collards Wrap</h2><p>Fold the black-eyed peas and collards into a wrap with a little hot sauce or some tzatziki.</p><h2>Vegetable Jambalaya Burrito</h2><p>Add some salsa or any leftover beans.</p><h2>Cauliflower Cheese Sandwich</h2><p>Add some crunchy greens and mustard. Yum!</p><h2>Roasted Vegetables Sandwich</h2><p>Add some extra spices or sauces to liven up the vegetables and grill the bread for some crunch.</p><h2>Roasted Potatoes and Chilies</h2><p>This dish is great in a taco—just add a little salsa and grated cheese. I like green salsa here.</p><h2>Tilapia Taco</h2><p>For a makeshift fish taco, chop up some crunchy cabbage and cilantro.</p><p>TODO(layout): No ingredients, steps, cost.</p>"
