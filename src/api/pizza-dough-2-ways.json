  "overview": "<p>There are two ways to make pizza dough: the fast way and the slow way. They’re the same amount of work, just with different waits. The slow method is convenient for a weekday if you make it before bed the night before, pop it in the fridge, then pull it out to rise before dinner.</p><h2>Fast Method</h2><p>TODO(layout): Content in default steps field</p><h2>Slow Method</h2><ul><li>If you’re organized enough to make the slow dough, I recommend taking the extra time: it’s the best.</li><li>Use the same process as at left, but add only ½ teaspoon of yeast to the flour mixture. Rather than room temperature, the water should be very cold.</li><li>After you place the dough ball in a bowl and cover it, put it into the fridge overnight. Letting the yeast work overnight creates a better flavor; it also makes the dough more elastic and easier to work with.</li><li>The next day, 2 to 3 hours before you want to bake your pizzas, remove the dough from the fridge to return to room temperature.</li></ul><p>TODO(layout): Two separate sets of steps, with headings.</p>",

        "3 cups all-purpose or bread flour",

  "steps": [
      "Measure out the flour, salt and a teaspoon of yeast into a big bowl. Mix the oil into the flour with your hands, crumbling it until the texture is a bit sandy, then add the room-temperature water. Keep mixing with your hands until it comes together.",
      "Knead the dough on a lightly floured countertop for 5 to 7 minutes, until it becomes a smooth elastic ball. The dough will be smooth but quite wet.",
      "Add a small amount of oil to a bowl. Place your dough ball in the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let it rise for 1½ to 3 hours, depending on the warmth of your kitchen. It’s done rising when it has doubled in size. Then it’ll be ready to shape into your favorite pizza!"
