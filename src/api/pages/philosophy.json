  "content": "<p>The best health advice is simple: eat fruits and vegetables. Many American cookbooks rely on meat as the central feature of a meal. My recipes celebrate the vegetables rather than the meat.</p><p>My intent was to create satisfying food that doesn’t require you to supplement your meals with cheap carbohydrates to stave off hunger. I strove to create recipes that use money carefully, without being purely slavish to the bottom line. For example, many recipes use butter rather than oil. Butter is not cheap, but it creates flavor, crunch, and richness in a way that cheap oils never can.</p><p>I’m not a dietician, and this isn’t a diet book. I’m just a home cook, like you. If you have dietary restrictions, some recipes won’t work for you as-is, but that’s fine—you can try to adapt them to your needs, or just turn the page and keep looking for inspiration.</p><p>More than a book of recipes, this is a book of ideas. I want you to tailor things to your taste. Improvisation is the soul of great cooking! If it doesn’t work out every time, I hope you’ll forgive me. More importantly, forgive yourself, and try again.</p>"
