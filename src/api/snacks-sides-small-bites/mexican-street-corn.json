  "overview": "<p>This recipe takes fresh, sweet summer corn—already amazing—and adds salt, tang, and spice to the experience. If you have an outdoor grill, prepare the corn that way, but for those without, a broiler is a great shortcut!</p>",
  "ingredients": [
    {
      "items": [
        "4 cobs corn",
        "4 tbsp mayonnaise",
        "½ cup cotija, queso blanco, feta, Romano or Parmesan, grated",
        "chili powder",
        "1 lime, sliced into wedges"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "steps": [
      "Turn your oven’s broiler up to high.",
      "Peel off the outer layers of the corn and clean off all the corn silk. Leave the green ends attached for a convenient handhold.",
      "Place the cobs on a baking pan under the broiler for 2 to 3 minutes, then rotate them and repeat until they’re brown and toasty all the way around. The broiling shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes total.",
      "Working quickly, spread a tablespoon of mayonnaise over each cob, lightly coating every kernel. Next, sprinkle the cheese all over the corn. It should stick fairly easily to the mayonnaise, but you’ll probably get a little messy coating them thoroughly.",
      "Sprinkle chili powder over the corn, but not too heavy or it’ll be gritty. Use any chili powder you like; ancho or cayenne are great.",
      "Lastly, squeeze lime juice all over and serve hot!"
