  "ingredients": [
    {
      "items": [
        "4 large sweet potatoes",
        "salt and pepper",
        "¼ cup sour cream",
        "½ bunch scallions, finely chopped"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "steps": [
      "Heat the oven to 400°F. Scrub the sweet potatoes and stab them with a fork a few times. Lay them on a baking sheet.",
      "Bake for 60 to 75 minutes. Because sweet potatoes vary greatly in size, check them after an hour by stabbing with a long knife. If it goes through easily, they’re ready. If not, bake longer.",
      "Let cool for 15 minutes. Make a long cut along the top of each potato and open them gently, beating with a fork to fluff up the soft, orange middle.",
      "Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Let each person add sour cream and scallions (or more salt and pepper) to their taste."
