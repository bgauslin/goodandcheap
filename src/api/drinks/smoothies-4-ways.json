  "overview": "<p>I have four types of smoothies here, but of course there are many more. Give these a try when you have overripe fruit that you wouldn’t eat otherwise. Add a teaspoon of vanilla to any of these and they will seem incredibly professional. The frozen melon drinks, in particular, are the most refreshing treat on a hot summer day.</p><h2>Drinkable Yogurt</h2><p>If you like the grocery store’s yogurt drinks, try making these at home for less! You don’t even need to blend them—just add the juice and yogurt to a jar, then shake.</p><ul><li>½ cup plain yogurt</li><li>½ cup fruit juice</li></ul><h2>Melon Smoothie</h2><p>When you buy a melon, dice and freeze whatever you don’t eat. Pull it out and blend it with a bit of water or juice to thin it out. It’s like a better slushy!</p><ul><li>1 cup frozen melon</li><li>½ cup water or juice</li><li>1 tsp vanilla</li></ul><h2>Berry Smoothie</h2><p>Blend until smooth, then adjust with more berries or milk to your taste.</p><ul><li>½ cup yogurt</li><li>1 cup frozen berries</li><li>milk or juice to thin as needed</li></ul><h2>Mango Lassi (not pictured)</h2><p>Blend the mango and yogurt together. If it’s too thick to drink with a straw, add some milk to thin it out. A ripe and juicy mango combined with thin yogurt is often all you need. Be warned: if you make this for children, they will request it over and over.</p><ul><li>1 mango, diced</li><li>1 cup yogurt</li><li>milk to thin as needed</li></ul><p>TODO(layout): Multiple variants with ingredients.</p>"
